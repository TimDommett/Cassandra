    <p className="about-paragraph"> Cassandra was created entirely using completely free online recorces by a developer with no previous experience to illustrate the power of free online education. Cassandra was desgined to be a hub for free online learning with the hope that it will make sorting through and finding quality educational recources easier for those looking.
    We live in a time where the cost of quality education is so high that not many people can afford it, leading to institutional class devides and unequal opportunity to jobs and hence a system whioch makes it extremely hard for individuals to break out of the income brackets that they were born into.
